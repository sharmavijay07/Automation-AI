# New Features Added - Screenshot, System Control, Multi-Task & Feature Tracking

## Overview
Added 4 major new capabilities to Vaani AI Assistant:
1. **Screenshot Capture** - Cross-platform screenshot functionality
2. **System Control** - Volume, lock, shutdown, restart, sleep commands
3. **Multi-Task Workflows** - Chain multiple agents together for complex tasks
4. **Feature Request Logger** - Track unimplemented features for future development

## 1. Screenshot Agent üì∏

### Features
- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - **Windows**: PowerShell with System.Drawing.Bitmap
  - **macOS**: Native `screencapture` command
  - **Linux**: `scrot`, `gnome-screenshot`, or ImageMagick `import`
  
- **Auto-Save Location**: `%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Screenshots\screenshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.png`

### Voice Commands
```
"take screenshot"
"capture screen"
"screen capture"
"take a screenshot"
```

### Implementation
**File**: `backend/agents/screenshot_agent.py`

**How it works**:
1. Parse voice command
2. Detect platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)
3. Execute platform-specific screenshot command
4. Save to Pictures/Screenshots with timestamp
5. Return path, size, and success status

**Example Response**:
```python
{
    "success": True,
    "message": "‚úÖ Screenshot captured successfully!",
    "path": "C:\\Users\\SURAJ\\Pictures\\Screenshots\\screenshot_20240115_143022.png",
    "size_kb": 1248.5
}
```

## 2. System Control Agent üéõÔ∏è

### Features
Control common system operations through voice commands.

### Supported Actions

| Category | Commands | Windows | macOS | Linux |
|----------|----------|---------|-------|-------|
| **Volume** | volume up, louder, increase volume | SendKeys | osascript | amixer |
| | volume down, quieter, decrease volume | SendKeys | osascript | amixer |
| | mute, unmute | SendKeys | osascript | amixer |
| **Lock** | lock, lock screen, lock computer | LockWorkStation | pmset displaysleepnow | xdg-screensaver |
| **Power** | shutdown, shut down, turn off | shutdown /s /t 10 | shutdown -h +1 | shutdown -h +1 |
| | restart, reboot | shutdown /r /t 10 | shutdown -r +1 | shutdown -r +1 |
| | sleep, hibernate | SetSuspendState | pmset sleepnow | systemctl suspend |

### Voice Commands
```
"volume up"
"increase volume"
"mute"
"lock screen"
"shutdown computer"
"restart"
"sleep"
```

### Implementation
**File**: `backend/agents/system_control_agent.py`

**Platform Detection**:
- Uses `platform.system()` to detect OS
- Maps actions to platform-specific commands
- Executes via `subprocess.Popen()`

## 3. Multi-Task Workflow Orchestrator üîó

### Features
Chain multiple agents together to complete complex multi-step tasks.

### Supported Patterns

#### Pattern 1: File + WhatsApp
**Voice**: "send apple.pdf to jay on whatsapp"

**Workflow**:
1. Task 1: `filesearch` - Find apple.pdf
2. Task 2: `whatsapp` - Send file to Jay

#### Pattern 2: Screenshot + Email
**Voice**: "take screenshot and email it to jay"

**Workflow**:
1. Task 1: `screenshot` - Capture screenshot
2. Task 2: `email` - Send screenshot to Jay

#### Pattern 3: Custom Chains
**Voice**: "find report and send to jay with message check this out"

**Workflow**:
1. Task 1: `filesearch` - Find report file
2. Task 2: `whatsapp` - Send with custom message

### Implementation
**File**: `backend/agents/multi_task_orchestrator.py`

**Detection Logic**:
```python
def detect_multi_task(user_input):
    # Pattern matching
    patterns = [
        r"(find|search).*file.*(send|share|email|whatsapp)",
        r"screenshot.*(and|then).*(send|share|email)",
        r".*\s+and\s+(then\s+)?(?:send|email|call)"
    ]
    
    # Multiple agent keyword detection
    # If 2+ agents detected ‚Üí multi-task workflow
```

**Execution Flow**:
1. Parse user input into task sequence
2. Extract agent name and parameters for each task
3. Execute tasks sequentially
4. Pass data between tasks (file path, screenshot path, etc.)
5. Stop on first failure or return success

**Data Passing**:
```python
Task 1: {"agent": "filesearch", "extract": "file_path"}
Task 2: {"agent": "whatsapp", "use_previous": "file_path"}
```

## 4. Feature Request Logger üìù

### Features
Track user requests that Vaani can't handle yet.

### Log Location
`backend/feature_requests.json`

### JSON Structure
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:22.123456",
    "user_input": "open browser and search for latest news",
    "detected_intent": "unknown",
    "reason": "No matching agent found",
    "suggested_agent": null,
    "context": {
      "original_input": "open browser and search for latest news",
      "enhanced_input": "open browser and search for latest news"
    },
    "status": "pending"
  }
]
```

### Implementation
**File**: `backend/utils/feature_request_logger.py`

**Features**:
- Auto-log unimplemented requests
- Track status (pending, implemented, rejected)
- Generate user-friendly messages
- Statistics and summary reports

**User Messages** (rotates based on count):
```
üöß This feature is not implemented yet. Your request has been logged for future development.

üìù I can't do that right now, but I've saved your request. We have 3 features in the pipeline!

‚ö†Ô∏è This capability isn't available yet, but your feedback helps us improve! Request logged.

üí° That's a great idea! I've logged your request for the development team to review.
```

### API Methods
```python
# Log a request
feature_logger.log_request(
    user_input="do something",
    detected_intent="unknown",
    reason="No matching agent",
    suggested_agent="new_agent_name"
)

# Get all requests
all_requests = feature_logger.get_all_requests()
pending = feature_logger.get_all_requests(status="pending")

# Mark as implemented
feature_logger.mark_implemented(request_id=1)

# Get statistics
summary = feature_logger.generate_summary()
```
