# 🔧 Bug Fix: Pydantic ClassVar Error

## ❌ Error Description

**Error Type:** `PydanticUserError`

**Error Message:**
```
A non-annotated attribute was detected: `WINDOWS_APPS = {...}`
All model fields require a type annotation
```

**Cause:** 
Pydantic v2.0+ requires all class-level attributes in classes inheriting from `BaseTool` to be properly type-annotated. Dictionary attributes need to be marked as `ClassVar` to indicate they're class variables, not instance fields.

---

## ✅ Files Fixed

### 1. `backend/agents/app_launcher_agent.py`
**Changes:**
- Added `ClassVar` import from `typing`
- Changed `WINDOWS_APPS = {...}` to `WINDOWS_APPS: ClassVar[Dict[str, str]] = {...}`
- Changed `WEBSITES = {...}` to `WEBSITES: ClassVar[Dict[str, str]] = {...}`

### 2. `backend/agents/websearch_agent.py`
**Changes:**
- Added `ClassVar` import from `typing`
- Changed `SEARCH_ENGINES = {...}` to `SEARCH_ENGINES: ClassVar[Dict[str, str]] = {...}`

### 3. `backend/agents/task_agent.py`
**Changes:**
- Added `ClassVar` import from `typing`
- Changed `TASKS_FILE = "tasks.json"` to `TASKS_FILE: ClassVar[str] = "tasks.json"`

### 4. `backend/requirements.txt`
**Changes:**
- Upgraded to `pydantic>=2.0` (explicit version requirement)
- Added `pydantic-settings` for configuration
- Added `langchain-core` for better compatibility
- Changed `python-magic` to `python-magic-bin` (Windows compatible)
- Changed `whisper-openai` to `openai-whisper` (correct package name)
- Added `psutil` for system utilities
- Reorganized for better clarity

## 🚀 How to Fix

### Option 1: Run the Fix Script (Recommended)

```powershell
# Run this from project root
.\fix_dependencies.ps1
```

This script will:
1. ✅ Activate virtual environment
2. ✅ Upgrade pip
3. ✅ Install/upgrade all dependencies
4. ✅ Test all imports
5. ✅ Confirm everything is working

### Option 2: Manual Fix

```powershell
# Navigate to backend
cd backend

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install core dependencies
pip install --upgrade pydantic>=2.0
pip install --upgrade langchain langchain-groq langchain-core langgraph

# Install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Test
python main.py
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### What is ClassVar?

`ClassVar` is a type hint from Python's `typing` module that indicates a variable is a class variable (shared across all instances) rather than an instance variable.

**Before (Error):**
```python
class MyTool(BaseTool):
    CONSTANTS = {"key": "value"}  # ❌ Pydantic thinks this is a field
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
from typing import ClassVar, Dict

class MyTool(BaseTool):
    CONSTANTS: ClassVar[Dict[str, str]] = {"key": "value"}  # ✅ Correct
```

### Why This Error Occurred

- Pydantic v2.0+ has stricter validation
- `BaseTool` from LangChain uses Pydantic models
- All attributes must be explicitly typed
- Class-level constants must use `ClassVar`

---

## ✅ Verification

After running the fix, verify with:

```powershell
# Test imports
python -c "from agents.app_launcher_agent import app_launcher_agent; print('✅ App Launcher OK')"
python -c "from agents.websearch_agent import websearch_agent; print('✅ Web Search OK')"
python -c "from agents.task_agent import task_agent; print('✅ Task Agent OK')"
python -c "from agents.agent_manager import agent_manager; print('✅ Agent Manager OK')"

# Start the server
python main.py
```

Expected output:
```

## 🎯 Prevention

To avoid similar errors in the future:

1. **Always type-annotate class attributes:**
   ```python
   class MyClass:
       name: str = "default"  # ✅ Good
       # name = "default"      # ❌ May cause issues
   ```

2. **Use ClassVar for class-level constants:**
   ```python
   from typing import ClassVar
   
   class MyClass:
       CONSTANT: ClassVar[str] = "value"  # ✅ Good
   ```

3. **Keep Pydantic updated:**
   ```powershell
   pip install --upgrade pydantic
   ```
