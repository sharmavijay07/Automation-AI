2. Speech-to-Text converts to text
3. Groq AI analyzes intent → "whatsapp"
4. Agent Manager routes to WhatsApp Agent
5. WhatsApp Agent:
   - Searches contact "vijay" → +919876543211
   - Generates WhatsApp URL with message
   - Opens WhatsApp Web with pre-filled message
6. You click "Send" ✅
```

### Application Opening
```
- Email → Opens default mail client (Outlook/Gmail)
- Calendar → Opens Google Calendar
- Phone → Opens Skype/system dialer
- Payment → Opens PayPal/payment app in browser
- Apps → Launches Windows applications directly
- Web Search → Opens browser with search results
```

## 💡 Smart Features

### Natural Language Understanding
```
"Call my mom" = "Phone mom" = "Dial mom's number"
All understood correctly by Groq AI!
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
```
"Find report and send to boss on WhatsApp"
→ File Search Agent finds file
→ WhatsApp Agent prepares message
→ Both results combined seamlessly
```

### Context-Aware Routing
```
"Open Chrome" → App Launcher Agent
"Open report.pdf" → File Search Agent
Intelligent distinction based on context!
```
