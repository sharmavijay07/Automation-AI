## üöÄ Advanced Features

### Multi-Agent Workflows

Vaani can coordinate multiple agents for complex tasks:

```
"Find ownership document and send to vijay on WhatsApp"
```

This command:
1. Uses File Search Agent to find the document
2. Uses WhatsApp Agent to prepare the message
3. Opens WhatsApp with pre-filled message and file info

### Natural Language Processing

Vaani understands natural language variations:
- "Call my mom" = "Phone mom" = "Dial mom's number"
- "Schedule a meeting" = "Create event" = "Add to calendar"
- "Send money" = "Make payment" = "Transfer funds"

2. Implement agent class with `process_command()` method
3. Register in `agent_manager.py`
4. Add keywords and routing logic
5. Update `main.py` agent_info

### Testing

# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest

# Frontend tests

npm test
```
